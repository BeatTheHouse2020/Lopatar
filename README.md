Not a script I would totally recommend but in the month he has earned +127k bits. He has lost only once where he then reset and played again.

Not a well written script as I was asked to copy his strategy so I did it pretty quickly and it works.. Didnt make the code pretty. Sorry.

HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:

Bets 14 bits at 1.25x and after each consecutive win it will increase the payout by .10

So 14 at 1.25 then 14 at 1.35, 14 at 1.45 etc until it loses.

When it loses it will bet 70 bits at 1.25x. If it loses against you skip 1 game then play 350 at 1.25x. Lose again it will then skip a game and the following game play 1750 bits at 1.25. If it loses again, it skips a game and then bets 8750 at 1.25. If you lose again, it will skip again and play 43750. If this loses the script ends. You will have to restart it up on this version to restart the game.
